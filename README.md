# Knowledge Nexus
### A collection of links and useful documents

This is a place to collect links to useful resources, pages, and anything else. You can also add new documents directly to this repository and create a link from a content page.

## How to use it

1. Please check if there is an appropriate topic for your documents. Use an existing topic for the document or create a new one. If you create a new topic, add a link to this README document.
2. If you are adding a document, create a subfolder in the topic folder. The subfolder should have a unique name and reflect the content. If you are adding a link, skip this step.
3. Add a link to the topic document. It should be an internal link to the folder you created, or to the README file in that folder. Or it should be an external link. The link must have a description of one to three sentences.

When deciding between a link or a document, keep in mind that people may suddenly delete useful documents from web servers. If a license permits, copy a document here. When creating a link, consider making a backup copy of the linked resource, such as on your computer.
